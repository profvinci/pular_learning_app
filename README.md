# Notes for me

1/19/2026:
Added:
    - Quiz (Words): quiz status, audio, answer field, check answer button and popup, ability to change pages
    - Vocab Word: validation logic

Goals for next times:
    - Keep track of how many were right vs wrong and a list of wrong ones. [QuizDetailPage and each question type widget]
    - Create a summary page that takes in those values and returns score in fraction, percentage, and list of wrong ones with correct answers. [summary page]
    - Have the submit answers button lead to summary page [QuizDetailPage]
    - duplicate work done for word typing for phrases and add to QuizDetailPage[Phrase_Typing]
    - Figure how to do speech recognition questions [Phrase_Speak] HUGE

Once all question types linked to Quiz detail page, I think the first version of the code can be packaged and emailed to Bax.

1/20/26:
- Lock text field after check answer
- have finish button correct on quiz page
- Make it work with phrases too
